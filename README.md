In our project users will be given 3 options to choose from 3 types of methods like Newton-Ruhson Method,Bi-section Method and SLE.
After choosing one option they will have to insert the variables of the equation . and then required other data based on the method. Then they will be shown all the iterative steps in  a table and the final answer in the end.
In this project we have used some python libraries like :sympy,scipy.misc,tabulate,array.At first we use sympy to use mathematical expressions and declare mathematical variables. Then we used scipy.misc to differentiate equations. As in numerical math differentiation is one the most mandatory devices to work with . Then we use array library and tabulate library to work with 2d lists and show all our steps in table format so users can have a good visualization.
